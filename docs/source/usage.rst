=================
Usage: REST APIs
=================

The API requests are grouped into two categories: data query requests,
which are *GET* requests. And control command requests, which are
*PUT* requests.

Each specific component defines its API. We have implemented two APIs
for controlling and querying data from SmartPlugs:

* Influx API: API for executing data queries to InfluxDB.
* sp_controller API: API for executing control
  commands (turn ON/OFF) to SmartPlugs.
